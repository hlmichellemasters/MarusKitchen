          <p>  Maru is a red tri-color Australian Shepherd.  This picture is from when he was a puppy, about 6 months old.  <br><br>
          He loves going for walks and going to the dog park, and he doesn't like to sit at home for very long.  He also requires a lot of training, because he gets bored quite easily.</p>

          <p> Before adopting Maru, we would often spend <em>hours </em> cooking in the kitchen. But, with the responsibilities of puppy parenting plus going to school, we quickly learned to appreciate the benefits of kitchen short cuts!<br><br> We rely heavily on our air fryer, instant pot, and our rice cooker to save a ton of time and create food that used to take hours and too much attention.

          <p>  In this recipe blog, you will only find meals and snacks that are either <b>simple to prep </b>for a whole week, or <b>very quick </b>to make. <br><br> This site focuses on primarily plant-based and relatively healthy foods, but we often save time by buying some food that is partially prepared, such as cauliflower rice and  chopped veggies.    </p>
